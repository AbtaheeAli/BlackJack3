Languages Used: C#

The back-end Blackjack application consisted of three classes:

- Card class
- Deck class
- Hand class
  The game logic is stored within the program.cs

---

Details of the "Card" class

- The card class is responsible for take the 13 ranks of the deck and assigning each rank to its value. For example, the rank "two" is assigned the value 2. Whenever the rank two is dealt to the user or house, it will return the numerical value of 2.

---

Details of the "Deck" class
List of Cards:

- A private list of cards is created where it stores each individual card to create the deck of 52 cards.

The Make Cards method:

- All the cards are represented as as string
- There are four suits: "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", and "Spades".
- There are 13 ranks: "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10",
  "Jack", "Queen", and "King"
- This method is called at the initial start of the game to create the deck of 52 cards

To shuffle the cards, I implemented the following:

- The Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm
- The shuffling algorithm starts with the last element in the deck of cards and swaps it with a randomly selected element that comes before it. This continues downward through the elements towards the first element

To deal the cards to user or house:

- The card that was placed at index [0] would be dealt and it would remove the card from the deck

---

Details of the "Hand" class:
List for Cards Held:

- Created to store information of the cards that are dealt to the user or house

Accept method:

- Takes card that is dealt from deck and gives it to the user or houses hand

Show The Cards method:

- Displays the rank and suit of each card in the users or house's hand
  Total Value method:
- Adds each card that is held and returns the total value of all cards in possession of the user or house

---

When the user starts a new game (game logic):

- A new deck is created and shuffled
- After the deck is shuffled, two cards are given to the user and it is shown on the console
- If the user's hand is not over 21 with the two cards that were dealt, the user is prompted the option to hit or stay,
- If the user chooses to hit:
  - Another card will be given to the user
  - If the user goes over 21, it is prompted that they have lost
- If the user chooses to stay, it is the house's turn
- If house is dealt a hand that is less than 17 than a card will be given to the house until they reach 17 or higher
- The winner is decided by:
  - If house hand has a greater total value than the user and it is not more than 21, house wins
  - If player hand has a greater total value than the user and it is not more than 21, user wins
  - if it is a tie, house wins
